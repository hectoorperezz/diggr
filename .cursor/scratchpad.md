# Diggr - AI-Powered Music Discovery Platform

## Background and Motivation
Diggr is designed for music enthusiasts who value deep discovery over passive listening. The platform allows users to create personalized playlists based on specific genres, moods, regions, and eras. Using AI, Diggr curates tracklists with both popular tracks and hidden gems, which can be saved directly to the user's Spotify account.

The key differentiator for Diggr is its focus on curation quality and deep music discovery rather than algorithm-driven mainstream recommendations. Users get an intentional, soulful playlist experience with both familiar tracks and B-sides they might have missed.

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: Next.js with App Router for server components and routing
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- **State Management**: React Context for global state, React Query for server state
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for transitions and micro-interactions
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form for form state and validation

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks and Mitigation Strategies

#### 1. Spotify API Rate Limits
**Risk**: Exceeding Spotify API rate limits, especially during high traffic.
**Mitigation**: Implement request batching, caching mechanisms, and rate limiting on our side. Use exponential backoff for retries.

#### 2. OpenAI API Costs
**Risk**: Unexpected OpenAI API costs if usage spikes.
**Mitigation**: Implement strict token limits, caching for similar requests, and budget alerts. Consider fallback strategies for high traffic periods.

#### 3. Inaccurate Music Recommendations
**Risk**: OpenAI generating recommendations that don't match user criteria.
**Mitigation**: Implement validation against Spotify API, develop comprehensive prompt engineering, and create feedback loops for continuous improvement.

#### 4. Authentication Security
**Risk**: Security vulnerabilities in the authentication flow.
**Mitigation**: Follow OAuth best practices, implement token refresh strategies, encrypt sensitive data, and regularly audit authentication flows.

#### 5. Payment Processing Issues
**Risk**: Failed payments or subscription management problems.
**Mitigation**: Extensive testing of Stripe integration, clear error handling, and robust webhook processing for subscription events.

- Ensuring proper indexing for performance

### 6. Authentication and Dashboard Loading Issues

#### Root Cause Analysis
The dashboard is not loading because of several potential issues with the authentication flow:

1. **Authentication Initialization Loop**: The SupabaseProvider is responsible for initializing the authentication state, but there might be a loop or timing issue with how the authentication is being initialized.

2. **Missing User Profile Data**: When a user signs in, a corresponding record should be created in the `users` table. If this record is missing or fails to be created, it could cause the dashboard to not render properly.

3. **State Management Issues**: The dashboard component relies on multiple state variables (`isLoading`, `hasCheckedAuth`, `session`, `user`, `userProfile`), and there might be a race condition or incorrect dependencies in the useEffect hooks.

4. **Client-Side Rendering Conflicts**: The dashboard uses both client-side and server-side data fetching, which might lead to hydration errors or mismatches.

5. **Error Handling**: The current error handling might be swallowing critical errors or not setting the error state properly, causing the dashboard to appear stuck in loading.

#### Impact
Users can't access the dashboard after logging in, effectively blocking them from using the application's core functionality.

#### Potential Solutions
1. Improve the authentication initialization logic to prevent multiple initializations
2. Enhance error handling in the SupabaseProvider to capture and display authentication errors
3. Ensure user profiles are automatically created when missing
4. Add more detailed logging to track the authentication flow
5. Restructure the dashboard component to handle loading states more gracefully

### 7. Settings Page UI Issues

#### Root Cause Analysis
The Settings page has several user interface issues that impact usability:

1. **Spotify Connection Button Logic**: The Spotify connection button is always clickable, even when a user is already connected. This can lead to confusion and unnecessary attempts to reconnect.

2. **Member Since Field Not Displaying Data**: The "Member Since" field is not properly displaying the user's registration date even though the user object should contain this information.

3. **Inefficient Status Checking**: The current implementation makes excessive database calls to verify the Spotify connection status, which could be optimized.

4. **Unclear Connection Status**: The status indication could be clearer, especially during loading states.

#### Impact
These issues lead to a confusing user experience in the Settings page, potentially causing users to attempt invalid actions or miss important account information.

#### Potential Solutions
1. Improve the Spotify connection button logic to ensure it's only clickable when appropriate
2. Fix the data formatting for the Member Since field
3. Optimize the status verification process to reduce database queries
4. Enhance the UI to more clearly indicate connection states

### Blockers
None currently - All tasks are progressing as expected.

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
Successfully improved the Settings page functionality:

1. Fixed the Spotify connection button logic to ensure it's only clickable when the user is not already connected.
2. Improved the Member Since date display with more detailed formatting.
3. Completely refactored the Spotify connection status verification to:
   - Prioritize using userProfile data when available (faster)
   - Only fall back to database queries when necessary
   - Provide clearer logging and error handling
   - Optimize the verification process to avoid redundant queries
4. Enhanced the UI with better status indicators and improved the user experience.

These improvements create a more intuitive and efficient user interface that clearly shows the user's account status and prevents them from attempting invalid actions.

## Lessons
1. When implementing OAuth flows, always ensure the exact same redirect URI is used throughout the flow and matches what's registered in the provider's dashboard.
2. Authorization codes from Spotify expire quickly (within a minute) and can only be used once.
3. Handle UI notifications carefully to prevent duplicate or endless notifications.
4. Implement proper error handling with detailed logs to diagnose authentication issues.
5. Create debug endpoints and pages when troubleshooting complex auth flows.
6. Process API requests in batches to avoid rate limits, especially when making multiple calls to external services.
7. Implement fallback strategies when searching for tracks, as AI recommendations might not exactly match Spotify's catalog.
8. Provide clear feedback to users throughout asynchronous processes like playlist creation.
9. When using authentication providers like Supabase in Next.js, prevent multiple initialization events to avoid re-rendering loops.
10. Always have a graceful error handling path for missing user profiles or auth state issues to prevent loading screens from getting stuck.
11. Consider using the authInitialized state variable pattern to ensure auth is only initialized once per session.
12. Be cautious with router refreshes in auth state changes as they can cause unnecessary re-renders or redirects.
13. Include info useful for debugging in the program output.
14. Read the file before you try to edit it.
15. If there are vulnerabilities that appear in the terminal, run npm audit before proceeding.
16. Always ask before using the -force git command.
17. When implementing favicons, ensure they're properly formatted and referenced in multiple ways to support various browsers.
18. For Next.js applications using the App Router, static assets in the public directory are automatically served at the root path.
19. Adding explicit link tags in the head section can help ensure browser recognition of favicons and logos.
20. In PostgreSQL, function overloading (multiple functions with the same name but different parameter signatures) can cause ambiguity errors. Always use unique function names or explicitly specify parameter types when calling functions, and include DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS statements in your migrations to avoid conflicts.
21. When handling UI state for connectivity or status features, ensure button enablement logic properly reflects the current state to prevent users from attempting actions that aren't applicable to their current state.
22. For status verification operations, prioritize using cached or already-available data (like userProfile) before making database queries to improve performance and reduce server load.
